//did feel a bit inelegant and as if I had to go around the world several times to get data successfully through the
//function.  That's ok.  I am sure there is a better way to implement quicksort with ArrayLists in Java and I will dis-
//cover it as I refine my understanding of the internals of the algorithm.
